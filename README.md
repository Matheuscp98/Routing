# üöö Routing: VBA Code

## üìù Description

This repository contains VBA code for **Routing Optimization** using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize routes considering both travel time and distance.

The methodology is discussed in the articles below, and the code is designed to run within Excel. Users can manage the registration of cities, vehicles, demands, products, fuels, and Google Maps or Street View APIs. The tool allows multi-objective optimizations with respect to time and distance, and all calculations and visualizations are performed directly in Excel via VBA.
