# Routing: VBA Code

## Description

This VBA code is designed to work with routing optimization using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize routes based on both travel time and distance. The methodology is discussed in the article:
- [Improvement in Logistical Efficiency with the Routing Optimization of a Coffee Company in Southern Minas Gerais](Paper.pdf)

The code is intended to run within Excel, allowing users to manage the registration of cities, vehicles, demands, products, fuels, and APIs related to Google Maps or Google Street View. Multi-objective optimizations can be performed in relation to both time and distance.

The main goal is to enable users to interactively optimize routes, utilizing VBA programming for calculations and visualizations directly in Excel.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Excel file containing the VBA macros.
3. Ensure that macros are enabled in Excel.
4. Run the desired VBA routines directly from the VBA editor or assign them to buttons in your Excel sheets.
5. The code includes detailed comments and auxiliary figures to help you understand its functionality.

## Worksheets Used

- **Dashboard**: Displays clients, current route, optimized route by distance, and optimized route by time.
- **Solver**: Multi-objective optimization using the Genetic Algorithm to determine the best route based on time and distance.
- **Registration**: General registration of cities, demands, vehicles, products, and fuels.
- **Distances**: Matrix representing distances.
- **Times**: Matrix representing travel times.
